This is a Ring-Flier project by Peter Batzel and Frank Magistrali in Spring 2010.

The object of Ring-Flier is to navigate your spaceship through as many rings as possible in the time given.  You can die by crashing in to the ground or walls (if there is ground/walls) or running out of time.

The controls are as follows:
Pitch: W, S
Roll: A, DSpeed Boost: Shift
Breaks: Ctrl or Space
Next Level: F1
Exit: Escape

Contributions:
We practiced Paired Programming for most of the project.  That is, we were both present for much of the programming using a single computer.  We took turns switching who was programming and who was helping.  Much of the time the person that wasn't programming was searching through documentations or Wiki pages.  As for our "assigned" parts, Frank took the UI and Peter took sound.  We both ended up helping eachother for much of both of these anyway.

Things we added since the demo:
-Sound is now 3D
-Each ring is assigned 1 of 5 humming sounds that it emits (for variety).
-A clock ticking sound has been added for when you are low on time.
-We altered the way you change the speed of the ship.
-We fixed a bug where your ship went partially into the ground before it exploded.


If you have any questions, please feel free to email either of us.
